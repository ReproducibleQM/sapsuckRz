Repo for Aphid Suction trap project.
This is going to be such a cool project!

data set available @ http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/datatables/122

google drive folder for non-code analysis @ https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/0B7EmIF4p0bakV01yanpHSHFYYzA?usp=sharing

We want to investigate the wheat pest aphid species as a first pass through the data. Planning on looking at niche partitioning and how it relates to weather patterns, crop locations and species abundances. Created a "wheat pest only" datafile on google drive, located at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9AoU-OS6qtgbFhrWmRTdnZiSTg

weather data pulled from the prism_weather_data_pull.R scirpt can be found at: https://figshare.com/articles/weather_data_csv/5012747
The analysis script pulls this data into R from figshare.

Decided not to take the route of niche partitioning as it didn't seem to pan out.
Currently exploring ideas like: date of emergence/peak abundance/crash; population structure, diversity
