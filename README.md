# SapsuckRz
Repo for Aphid Suction trap project.

We aim to investigate how climate and landscape (including crop cover) affect aphid emergence and peak abundace across a large extent of the United States over a period of 11 years (2005-2015). We hope to understand potential drivers of pest and non-pest aphid species abundance and how this might change due to antropogenic climate change.

## Data we are using

We will be combining aphid suction trap data from 46 sites across the U.S. with climate and landscape data

Aphid abuance data set available from [KBS LTER database](http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/datatables/122)

weather data pulled from the [prism_weather_data_pull.R](https://github.com/ReproducibleQM/sapsuckRz/blob/master/prism_weather_data_pull.R) scirpt can be found on figureshare: [here](https://figshare.com/articles/weather_data_csv/5012747)
The analysis script pulls this data into R from figshare.
