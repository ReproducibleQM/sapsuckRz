Repo for Aphid Suction trap project.
This is going to be such a cool project!

data set available @ http://lter.kbs.msu.edu/datatables/122

We want to investigate the wheat pest aphid species as a first pass through the data. Planning on looking at niche partitioning and how it relates to weather patterns, crop locations and species abundances. Created a "wheat pest only" datafile on google drive, located at: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B9AoU-OS6qtgbFhrWmRTdnZiSTg
