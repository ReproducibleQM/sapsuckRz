Project: Aphid flight patterns in the US midwest

Data source: Aphids are tiny soft-bodied herbivores with very interesting life cycles- 
many species alternate between host species at different times of the year, and will also migrate between 
hosts of the same species due to a variety of environmental or densitiy dependant triggers. 
The Midwestern Aphid Suction trap network was established in 2004, originally as a surveilance tool for the recent 
invader and economic pest, soybean aphid. Its 42 sites stretch over a 1000 km x 1000 KM area in the US midwest, from Manhattan, 
KS, in the south to Crookston MN in the north, and Brookings SD to I can't remember the site, but it's an MSU station near lake Erie. 
The network provides weekly data on aphid captures May-September. Aphids are idenified to species, sex, and tallied for each location 
for each week. Approximately 120 species have been captured by this network, with ~25 species common enough to support a meaningful 
analysis of some kind. The survey was initiated by David Voegtlin of the Illinois Natural History Survey, and since he retired, 
has been maintained by Doris Lagos, an (amazing) aphid systematist. Dr. Christie Bahlai is their database manager, and holds 
the database at the KBS data repository.
