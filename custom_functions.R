# functions for processing weather data as adapted from Hermann et al 2016 RSOS

#because these functions rely on accumulation calculations, missing data is problematic
# the replace missing function was written to estimate missing values by simply repeating 
#the data from the measurement of that kind taken before. It's not perfect but probably 
#the issues come out in the wash

#feed in a vector of values, it'll create a vector object with the missing values replaced
# works for columns in data frames, too
replace.missing<-function(vec){
  #create a vector to put our new values into
  New = c()
  for (i in 1:(length(vec))){

      #if the data is missing, sub in the value from the measurement before
      
    } else{
      #if the value is not missing, just pass it through to the result vector

#we'll need to operate on a dataset that's sorted in a decending way
#for this because it's easier to think about accumulations that way
#so before using the functions below, make sure data is sorted in decending order
#by date, ie row 1 is January 1 1900, row 2 is january 2 1900, etc
